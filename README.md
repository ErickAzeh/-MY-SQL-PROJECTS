# -MY-SQL-PROJECTS

# Welcome to My SQL Portfolio!

Thank you for visiting my SQL code repository! Here, you'll find a collection of SQL queries and scripts that showcase my ability to work with data to generate valuable insights. Each project demonstrates my approach to problem-solving, analytical thinking, and technical skills in SQL, from basic data manipulation to complex data analysis.

Iâ€™ve organized the projects to highlight various aspects of my SQL expertise, including data filtering, aggregation, joins, and subqueries. These examples reflect real-world scenarios, such as analyzing sales data, inventory management, and customer insights, to show how I use SQL to provide practical business solutions.

Please feel free to explore the repository, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, feedback, or collaboration ideas. Enjoy browsing my work!
